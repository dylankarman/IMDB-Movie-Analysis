Microsoft has approached William Adams and me to review over 6,500 movies ranging from 1986-2016 in order to see which movie would be the most profitable.
Through careful analysis of the data set using many different built in Panda's methods, William and I made Pandas DataFrames and then made various Pandas and Seaborn graphs to show the correlations between 4 distinct categories and profit.
    Genre: Which genres create the most profit
    Average lengths of the films
    Director: Which directors appear the most times on the highest grossing films list and their profits.
    Rating: Which ratings are producing the most money.
    
I also went a bit further and dove into what the average budgets for the films were per year versus what the average profits were per year. 

We concluded that either an Animation, Action, or Adventure movie with a length of ~110 minutes, directed by Peter Jackson, and rated PG-13, was the most profitable combination of movies.
